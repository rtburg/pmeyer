<br><font size=+2 color="#FF0000" face="Arial,Helvetica">How to do an Election Survey</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The following statement is true,
even though almost everyone involved in election polling denies it.</font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">The purpose of an election
survey is to predict the outcome of the election.</font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Editors, pollsters, and pundits
will curse, evade, or ignore the truth of that statement, sometimes with
great heat. But it is still true. And if you are going to do election surveys,
you might as well get used to this simple fact: your success or failure
will be judged by how well your poll predicts the outcome. It is a reasonable
test, and a fair one.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">In polling, there are not many opportunities
to test the validity of a poll against the real-world values that the poll
is supposed to approximate. The reason is as obvious as it is simple: if
we could measure the real-world values, we wouldn't need a poll in the
first place.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">There are two exceptions to this
general rule. One is the United States Census, which does a valiant job
of attempting to reach everybody and collect some basic information about
each person. One way to check on the validity of a poll is to compare the
demographics of the poll's sample with the census demographics of the population
from which the sample is drawn. This method works best in years close to
the census.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman"><a name="215"></a>The other opportunity for such an
external test of validity comes with every election. If 56 percent of a
sample says it is going to vote for Crockett for mayor, and if the sampling
error is four percentage points, and if Crockett gets between 52 and 60
percent of the vote, the poll has passed the test. Such a test separates
the wimps from the stout-hearted in a way that a comparison with the census
does not. If the census says that a population is 22 percent black and
the poll only finds 15 percent, the pollster will merely shrug and crank
in a statistical weight bringing blacks up to their quota. (An ethical
pollster will report that procedure.) But the pressures of election reporting
compel the poll to be published <i>before</i> the validity check, which
is poetic justice indeed. There is no way to hide from it or cover it up
with cosmetic weighting procedures.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Watch the newspapers in the last
two weeks of any national election. You will find that the weaker polls
suddenly become silent. Ask why, and you get a variety of reasons: the
polling budget ran out, polling distracts attention from the issues, it
might affect the outcome of the election, etc. Don't believe any of them.
The real reason is that the pollster doesn't want the poll to be compared
to the election. By stopping two weeks in advance, he or she can claim
that the poll was accurate as of the time it was taken, no matter how the
election turns out. If the election results differ from the poll results,
the voters must have changed their minds. As, indeed, voters sometimes
do.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">An election poll is, of course,
good for other things than predicting the outcome of elections. It can
show what issues are motivating the voters. It can measure familiarity
with the issues and the candidates. It can show what coalitions are being
formed or renewed. It can provide insights into candidate strategy that
are in turn derived from the candidate's own polls.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">But to do any of these good things,
the poll must be a valid representation of the participating electorate.
And the election is the check on whether it succeeds at that. This chapter
is about the things you can do to make certain that your own poll matches
the election outcome.<br>
</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1><a name="216"></a></font><b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Sampling</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Very few organizations are content
with single preelection polls. If one poll is newsworthy, a lot of polls
are a lot more newsworthy. To pay for more polls, there is a strong temptation
to cut costs in procedure, and sampling is a frequent target for cutting.
Because personal, in-home interviews are too slow for the competitive needs
of modern media, virtually all election polls are done now by telephone.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Drawing a representative sample
of telephone households is easy using the random-digit methods discussed
in chapter 6. The issue is how far down the respondent selection process
randomness needs to be preserved. In the 1980s, many polls used quota selection
to choose a respondent within the random household. This practice had theoretical
justification in the 1970s because members of the same household tended
to have similar political views and to vote alike. Ronald Reagan changed
that. Two trends, the growth of the women's movement and the rightward
movement of the Republican Party combined to make voting behavior correlate
with gender in a way that it had not done before. Journalists called the
phenomenon the "gender gap" when women were suddenly more likely to be
Democrats than men.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Suddenly a quota sample did not
look as good. Although the gender difference could be controlled to some
extent by setting quotas for males and females, the breakup of homogeneous
households raises the possibility that household members might vary in
other ways not controlled by the quotas. Probability sampling down to the
individual level is therefore the safest procedure, but it comes at a cost.
It requires taking the time to list the household members, to choose one
at random, and to call back later if that person is not at home. Irving
Crespi, in his excellent roundup of current wisdom on election polls, reports
that failure to conduct callbacks leads to underrepresentation of Democrats <font SIZE="2">ñ</font></font><font size="2">
</font><font size=+1>Republicans
evidently being more likely to be found at home on a typical evening.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-1" name="9return1">1</a></sup></font></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Polls using callbacks generally
set a fixed number of attempts, usually one, two, or three, and dedicate
the last night or two of a poll to finishing up the callbacks. That procedure <a name="217"></a>
necessarily extends the polling period, which is another cost when you
are under deadline pressure.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Refusals</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The nerd boxes <font SIZE="2">ñ</font></font><font size="2">
</font><font size=+1>those little clumps
of agate type that newspapers use to disclose the methods and limitations
of their polls <font SIZE="2">ñ</font></font><font size="2"> </font><font size=+1>rarely talk about refusals. But refusals are one of the
main sources of error in all polls. Their effect is far more serious than
sampling error because you can't estimate their effect the way you can
specify the probability of different ranges of sampling error. In fact,
the maddening thing about this source of error is that it is often totally
unpredictable. Often it will cause no visible error at all. This is true
because of the following general rule:</font></font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">A bias in a sample will be
both invisible and harmless so long as the bias is not correlated with
anything that you are trying to measure.</font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">To make the harmless bias rule intuitively
clear, think about a barrel of apples. You want to estimate the ratio of
green apples to ripe apples in the barrel. The apples were thoroughly mixed
before they were packed. Therefore, you can draw your sample from the apples
in the top of the barrel, which are the easiest to get, and make a good
estimate. Position in the barrel does not correlate with greenness.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Now suppose that the barrel was
packed by some sinister force. It did not want you to know about the green
apples, and so it put them all in the bottom of the barrel. Take a sample
from the top, generalize to the barrel as a whole, and you will be wrong.
This time, the bias in your selection is correlated with the thing you
are measuring.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The harmless bias rule sounds like
a gift to pollsters. It is not. The only way to be sure that a bias is
harmless is to compare the biased sample with an unbiased one -- or, as in
the case of an election or a census, with the total population. A bias
that is harmless in one poll can give you an unjustified sense of confidence
and set you up for a disaster in the next poll. That happened to the <i>Literary
Digest</i> in 1936. Its sample <a name="218"></a> was based on telephone and motor vehicle
registration lists, both indicators of relative affluence. Affluence was
not correlated with voter choice in 1932, and its poll was right on the
mark. Then President Roosevelt built his New Deal coalition of farmers,
workers, and minorities and caused a historic party realignment that left
voter choice very much correlated with economic status. The <i>Literary
Digest</i> confidently repeated its biased sampling in 1936, was horribly
wrong, and did not live to poll again. George Gallup used an unbiased sample,
got it right, and became the dominant pollster of his time.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">This history is worth remembering
when we think about refusals. About a third of the people contacted in
telephone surveys refuse to be interviewed. Refusal to participate has
been shown to correlate with age (older people are less likely to consent
to an interview), with education (the less educated are the most reluctant),
and with urban residence (city dwellers are less likely to cooperate).
Place of residence is more of a problem with face-to-face interviews than
with telephone interviews.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-2" name="9return2">2</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">These factors give a Republican
bias to telephone interviews. As luck would have it, they also provide
some correction for another problem faced by election polls: weeding the
nonvoters out of the sample. The same people who don't like to take part
in telephone interviews tend to be the same people who don't like to vote.
This is good luck for pollsters, but it is the same kind of luck that the <i>Literary Digest
</i> enjoyed in 1932. A benign correlation pattern could
turn nasty in some future election campaign. And there is not much a pollster
can do about it except watch out for issues that involve old folks, the
less educated, and city dwellers. Some day they will do important things
that the conventional polls will not detect. Think about that if you are
a young person hoping to make a name in this business. If you can anticipate
that inevitable day and avoid the bias that sends the conventional pollsters
running for the hills, you could be the Gallup of the twenty-first century.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Identifying the likely voters</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The low election participation rates
in the United States <a name="219"></a> make life hard for pollsters. In the 1988 presidential
election, only 50 percent of the voting age population showed up at the
polls. The low turnout creates two obvious problems:</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">1. You need a bigger sample. To
get the 3 percent error margin provided by a sample of 1,000, you have
to interview 2,000 people in order to end up with 1,000 voters.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">2. You have to figure out which
of the people in your oversized sample will belong to the voting 50 percent.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The second problem is by far the
most difficult. Of course, you can just ask people if they plan to vote
or not. The trouble with that tactic is that voting is perceived as a socially
useful activity, and so respondents do not like to admit not participating.
About 80 percent say they are registered, but only about 65 percent actually
are. And those who are registered greatly overestimate their likelihood
of voting.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Over the years, pollsters have developed
a number of stratagems for weeding out the nonvoters. At one point, the
Gallup Poll used nine questions to predict turnout likelihood, built them
into a scale, and then went back to the public records after the election
to see who really did vote. From that information, a statistical weighting
procedure was devised based on the predictive power of each of the nine
items. Some of the nine items were direct and some were oblique. Samples:</font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">Generally speaking,
how much interest would you say you have in politics -- a great deal, a fair
amount, only a little, or no interest at all?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">How often would you
say you vote ñ always, nearly always, part of the time, or seldom?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">Here is a picture of
a ladder. Suppose we say the top of the ladder, marked 10, represents a
person who definitely will vote in the election this November, and the
bottom of the ladder, marked zero, represents a person who definitely will
not vote in the election. How far up or down the ladder would you place
yourself?<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-3" name="9return3">3</a></sup></font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The best predictors were a registration
question, a direct question about the respondent's plans to vote in the
upcoming election, the ladder scale, and the question on frequency <a name="220"></a> of voting.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-4" name="9return4">4</a></sup>
All nine questions were used to form a cumulative scale. At the top of
the scale, where people gave all the pro-voting answers, turnout averaged
87 percent. At the bottom of the scale, it was only 8 percent.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The straightforward way to apply
this scale, and the method used for many years by the Gallup Poll, was
to array all of the respondents along the scale according to the likelihood
of their voting and then estimate the turnout. If a turnout of 50 percent
was expected, then the people who formed the bottom half of the sample
in voting likelihood would be dropped and the prediction would be based
on those who were left. The Gallup folks, leaving as little as possible
to chance, also used their turnout scale to estimate the turnout itself.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1>This bootstrapping is effective,
but a hardworking pollster who goes to all of the trouble to interview
hundreds or even thousands of people hates to throw half of those interviews
away. The Election and Survey Unit at CBS News found a way to avoid that.
Using the same kind of public-record data to find which survey respondents
really vote, they constructed a voting-rate scale using the same principles
as Gallup's but with fewer questions. Then they used these probabilities
as weights across the entire sample. A person with an 89 percent probability
of voting gets a statistical weight of .89. The respondent with only a
3 percent chance is weighted at .03. Every interview is used, and the probability
model should, in theory, project to the election with at least as much
accuracy as the model that drops the least likely voters. It worked well
for the CBS News/<i>New York Times</i> Poll in 1988. However, Crespi reports
that polling organizations that use such weighting schemes are less likely
to be successful predictors of election outcomes than those that kick the
low-likelihood voters all the way out of the sample. Paul Perry, the quiet
statistician who guided the Gallup Poll in its years of methodological
improvement after 1948, tried using a weighting model with his data and
found that the results were almost identical. So he stuck to the cut-off
model because of its simplicity -- a virtue when you are under deadline pressure.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-5" name="9return5">5</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman"><a name="221"></a>One reason for the success of the
CBS method is the use of an internal check to catch voters who are lying
about being registered. The following three questions are asked:</font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">What was the most recent
election of any kind you voted in? (PROBE) What year was that?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">When was the last time
you registered to vote? What year was that?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">Did you live in the
same community two years ago that you live in now?</font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">With these facts in hand, it is
possible to screen out respondents who could not legally be registered.
Most states purge their rolls of voters who have not voted after a certain
time period. Before each election, CBS News checks the laws of each state
to see what that time period is. If the person last voted six years ago,
and the time period for his or her state is four years, voting in the current
election is probably not possible. And those who have moved in the past
two years but have not reregistered are also considered ineligible. Both
groups get a voting probability of zero.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The remaining voters are divided
into twelve categories, depending on their past voting frequency and their
interest in the campaign. A different probability is assigned to each category.
The range is 89 percent to 3 percent.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">A cheaper method</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The CBS method is effective but
complicated. Simpler methods are cheaper. Many election pollsters try to
identify the likely nonvoters at the very front of the interview, so that
they can get rid of them immediately. Why spend 20 minutes on the telephone
with someone whose interview you are going to throw out at the analysis
stage? If a person's responses indicate that he or she will not vote, the
interviewer can politely end the conversation and go on to the next number.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">But watch out! If the procedure
calls for the interviewer to hang up without collecting the basic demographic
data, the means for checking the sample against the known census characteristics
is lost. So some low-budget pollsters design the survey to collect at least
that much information from the <a name="222"></a> likely nonvoters so that they will have
a sample of the entire population to compare to census information. Weighting
can be performed on the total sample to make it conform to the census,
and then the nonvoters can be dropped out.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Here's another way. The need to
collect demographic data from folks who are not likely to vote can be avoided
without forgoing demographic weighting altogether. The Bureau of the Census
asks about voting participation in its Current Population Survey. From
that survey, one can derive estimates of the demographic characteristics
of the voting population. Weight your sample of likely voters to conform
to those demographic estimates, and you have bypassed the need to deal
with nonvoters at all.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">But there are a couple of problems.
One is that the census survey is notoriously inaccurate. Far more people
claim to have voted than actually turned out. Another potential problem
is that the turnout patterns of past elections may not be the same as the
pattern for the current election. And the census survey is national in
scope. The turnout demographics in the city or state you are surveying
might be quite different.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The old Gallup method of throwing
away the unlikely voters still looks pretty good. That system was based
on personal, in-home interviews. Telephone interviewing adds a complication,
because the telephone itself is a kind of nonvoter screen due to its bias
against the less educated. This bias, you will recall, stems from higher
refusal rates among the less educated as well as the unevenness of telephone
penetration. Therefore, if you expect a turnout of 50 percent and drop
50 percent from your sample, you will have dropped too many. If one-third
of those called refused the interview, and if they are all nonvoters, you
have already eliminated a substantial portion of the nonvoting problem.&nbsp;</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">
It is somewhere around here that polling ceases to be a science and becomes
an art. You need to build some experience in your state or city to find
out what kind of nonvoter correction works best. Some pollsters get by
with a short, sweet method: ask one screening question about registration
and one about likelihood of voting, and count only those who say they are
registered and certain to vote. This method <a name="223"></a> generally eliminates far fewer
unlikely voters than are theoretically necessary, but the remainder tend
to eliminate themselves by not having telephones or by refusing the interview.
Such a shortcut is quick, it is easy, and it is cheap. Crespi, however,
reports that polls that use this method do not enjoy the accuracy of those
that use a tighter screen, i.e., with more questions. It did not appear
to make much difference in the polls that Crespi looked at whether the
questions were used as up-front screeners or applied after the fact to
dump the unlikely voters.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-6" name="9return6">6</a></sup> The after-the-fact method is more
theoretically sound, however, because it gives you a full-population sample
to evaluate against the census.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Asking the question</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Most polls stick pretty close to
the Gallup language with only minor variations:</font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">If the presidential
election were being held today, which would you vote for <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman"><b>--</b></font>
the Republican
candidates, Bush and Quayle, or the Democratic candidates, Dukakis and
Bentsen? (If undecided) As of today, do you lean more toward Bush and Quayle
or to Dukakis and Bentsen?</font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Giving the party identification
is essential, because party label remains one of the basic tools used by
voters in arriving at a decision. The order in which the candidates are
named can also make a difference. Unfortunately, there is a big gap in
the literature about the nature of that difference. In an experiment with
the Carolina Poll in the 1988 presidential election in North Carolina,
we found a <u>recency</u> effect. We programmed our CATI system so that
the interviewers named the Democratic candidates first for a random half
of the sample and the GOP contenders were first in the other half. Bush
and Quayle did better when they were named last. As it happened, they were
listed last on the North Carolina ballot, and that version proved to be
the most accurate in predicting the election. This outcome is at least
consistent with theory. The form of the survey question should be as much
like the form of the election question as possible, down <a name="224"></a> to the relative
positioning of the candidates. Since the vice-presidential candidate is
listed on the ballot along with the presidential candidate, both names
should be in the survey question.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">One reason the internal order effect
has never received much attention may be that it is fairly well randomized
nationally. However, when the Gallup Poll used a paper ballot in personal
interviews, care was taken to match the candidate order with the actual
ballot in each state. That order varies because the party in power in each
state generally tries to rig the ballot to its own benefit. Political folklore
expects a <i>primacy</i> effect, meaning that the candidates mentioned
first should be favored. But if the single experiment in North Carolina
is indicative, they have it all wrong and are actually hurting their candidates
by putting them first on the ballot.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Folklore is often well grounded,
and it should not be lightly dismissed on the basis of a single experiment.
Perhaps primacy effect was dominant in an earlier period, when people had
more time to look at things and ponder them. Recency effect, on the other
hand, could be the product of the information overload of our age. With
so much data streaming through our heads, there may be less chance of any
given particle staying put there for very long. If so, the most recently
processed quanta could have the best chance of remaining salient. Or perhaps
primacy effect dominates in written communication and recency effect in
oral communication. If that is true, matching the ballot order is not important,
and you should probably neutralize the effect by rotating candidate order.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Dealing with the undecided</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">One difference between an election
and a poll is that in the privacy of the voting booth, all but a very few
can make up their minds. In a poll a significant minority are still undecided.
If the election is to be the standard by which the poll is judged, some
procedure needs to be found to deal with the undecided.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">As the election gets closer, the
number of undecided begins to drop, but levels of 10 to 15 percent in the
final days <a name="225"></a> are not uncommon. Some media pollsters are perfectly happy with
that. The cushion of undecided makes a nice explainer if the poll turns
sour. If a poll shows a 40-40 tie with 20 percent undecided, the election
results can be as lopsided as 60-40 in either direction, and a pollster
can claim that his or her results were right on the money and those pesky
undecided voters all went the same way. (Pollsters do make outlandish excuses.
In 1989, one pollster caught with a bad prediction claimed that it was
the respondents' fault for lying to his interviewers.)</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Paul Perry of the Gallup Organization
struggled for years with the problem of allocating the undecided and concluded
that reducing their number is a lot easier than figuring out what they
are going to do. The "leaning" question, the second part of the two-part
Gallup question cited above, will cut the undecided by about half. Using
it is simple. Just add the leaners to the decided group and report both
totals, but make it clear that you are basing your election prediction
on the sums with the leaners included. The procedure clearly improves predictive
power.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-7" name="9return7">7</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">In personal interviews, the undecided
can be reduced still more by using a secret ballot. Instead of asking the
respondent how he or she plans to vote, the interviewer offers a printed
ballot and displays a box with a padlock and a big label, "SECRET BALLOT
BOX." The paper ballot also makes it possible to replicate the physical
layout of the real ballot so that any positional biases in the actual election
are built into the poll as well. This can be an important advantage in
a state that allows straight-ticket voting. It is easier to simulate the
straight-ticket option on paper than it is in a telephone interview. The
straight-ticket choice can be offered in a telephone survey, however, and
you should consider it if you are polling in a state that uses straight-ticket
voting and if there are state and local candidates who might receive some
coattail effect from better-known national candidates.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Allocating the remaining undecided</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Even after the leaning question,
a hard core of undecided voters remains. What to do about them? Paul Perry
found <a name="226"></a> that many of them are unlikely to vote at all. In the 1976 Gallup
Poll, for example, the leaning question reduced the undecided to 5 percent.
Kicking out the unlikely voters dropped it to 3.7 percent.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-8" name="9return8">8</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Lots of different ways have been
tried for getting rid of that last remnant of undecided respondents. There
are complicated ways and simple ways. An example of a complicated way would
be to use a powerful statistical model such as Logit or Probit to predict
candidate choice from demographic and issue preference variables. These
are regressionlike models that deal with categorical variables. Some pollsters
have tried splitting the undecided by party preference. Nick Panagakis
of Market Shares Corporation believes that in state and local elections,
the undecided tend to go against the incumbent. My own work with the Carolina
Poll suggests that it is hard to beat the procedure of dropping the undecided
from the percentage base in making the final prediction. It has the virtue
of simplicity. And it is based on a reasonable theory: that many of the
hard-core undecided will not vote, and those who do will tend to divide
in the same way as those who have decided. Crespi, after looking at the
records of a number of pollsters, endorses this practice, although he also
believes there may be something to be said for basing the division on party
affiliation.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-9" name="9return9">9</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000"><b>Weighting</b></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">In considering whether to weight
your data, it is important to keep this distinction in mind: Some weights
are <i>design weights</i> built into the sampling procedure. Others are <i>corrective weights</i> employed after the fact to fix (or cover up)
flaws in the sample. Use of the latter is controversial. Employment of
the former is not.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The obvious example of a design
weight in a telephone survey is household size. Most phone surveys are
designed to obtain only one interview from a household that was selected
with a probability of being chosen equal to that of all other households.
That means that people from large households get less of a chance to be
interviewed than people from small households. The inequity is easily corrected
by weighting for <a name="227"></a> household size. A person in a household with four adults
gets counted with four times the weight of a person who lives alone.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">In the old days before computers,
weighting was done by replicating cards. An interview from a four-person
household would have its card copied three times. SAS and SPSS make weighting
easier. It is all done mathematically inside the computer. To keep the
weighting from inflating sample size and throwing off your statistical
tests, you can divide each person's household size by the average household
size to arrive at the final weight. For example, if the average household
size is two, the four-person household will have a weight of two, and the
one-person household will have a weight of one-half.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Corrective weights are another matter.
The theory behind them is less sound. In the Carolina Poll we typically
get 15 percent black respondents, even though the true proportion of blacks
in the voting-age population is closer to 21. Weighting the 15 percent
up to 21 is based on a theoretical assumption that we know is wrong: that
the blacks who cannot be reached by telephone are just like those whom
we do reach. In fact, they are poorer, younger, more alienated, more likely
to be male. But we do the weighting anyway. Why? It helps the election
prediction. Unrepresentative blacks are better than no blacks at all.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The only other weight we use in
the Carolina Poll is for age category. In some elections it makes a difference,
as when social security is an issue. Our poll usually needs adjustment
of no more than a point or two in each category.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The source for the weighting data
is a biennial publication of the Bureau of the Census. Early in each election
year, it produces a report for each state on the characteristics of the
voting-age population. The report is based on estimates and projections
from the most recent census, but it is the best estimate of what's really
out there that you can get.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-10" name="9return10">10</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Some pollsters go much more heavily
into weighting. There are basically three ways to do it.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Sequential weighting. </i>
Put the weights in one at a time. After each weighting, run a new frequency
count and check the next variable that you intend to weight, so that you
can <a name="228"></a> calculate how much adjustment it needs. Proceed in this manner until
all of the weights are in.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Problem: one weight affects another.
For example, if your first weight is to bring up the proportion of blacks,
you will throw off the sex balance because black respondents are disproportionately
female. Fix the gender balance, and race goes back out of line.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">2. <i>Cell weighting.</i> Find out
from census data what proportion of the population is in every possible
combination of your weighting categories. If you are weighting by age,
sex, race, and education, find out what the population has in each combination,
cell by cell.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Problem: there can be a lot of cells.
Figure four categories of age, two of sex, three of race, and five of education.
That's 120 cells. Some will be very small. A few might even be empty. A
few wildly deviant cases might get blown up to create some large and strange
effect.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">3. <i>Rim weighting.</i> A computer
program applies weights in sequential fashion, varying the order, and checking
the marginals to find the optimum solution. It stops when it finds a simple
combination of weights that yields good approximations for the marginals
(total frequencies) of the weight variables.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Problem: it takes a special
computer program. When I last looked, neither SAS nor SPSS offered rim
weighting, although they well might by the time you read this.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The experience of the Carolina Poll
suggests that it is good to be conservative about weighting. In North Carolina,
at least, the telephone itself is a crude nonvoter screen. When we try
to weight for education, we destroy that feature by boosting the influence
of low-educated unlikely voters. Our best election predictions are produced
when we weight by race and age and, when necessary, gender. Crespi reports
that those are the most popular weighting variables among the polls that
he examined, and that those who weight get better predictions than those
who do not.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-11" name="9return11">11</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1><br>
</font><b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">What to do when</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">It used to be so simple. Pollsters
took their time, collected results from interviewers by mail, and reserved
the more <a name="229"></a> complicated procedures, including adjustments for undecided and
nonvoters, for the last poll before the election. That tended to give the
national polls a Democratic bias in the early going. Unlikely voters are
disproportionately Democrats, and so dropping them out gave the Republicans
an apparent last-minute boost.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Competition has made the national
polls more honest. The nonvoter screens now kick in much earlier. CBS starts
limiting its reports to what it calls "the probable electorate" with its
first survey in the September before a national election. When national
polls give sharply different results in late summer the differences can
sometimes be traced to differences in timing for the nonvoter screen.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Older polls differed from today's
in another important way. They assumed a voter decision model that was
relatively static. It assumed that once you had the voters pegged, they
would not change very much. That assumption was one of the causes of the
great debacle of 1948, when all the major polls predicted that Thomas E.
Dewey would defeat President Harry S Truman. The pollsters quit too soon,
and a lot of disaffected Democrats who had earlier vowed not to vote for
Truman came back to the fold near the end of the campaign.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Today's media-driven campaigns and
the related decline of party loyalties produce elections that are even
more volatile. Polling data suggest that Jimmy Carter lost the 1980 election
in the last 48 hours of the campaign.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Such instability makes election
predictions more difficult, but the track records of the serious pollsters
is still quite good. Timing is now considered critical. All of the careful
methodological details discussed above take time. When do you stop and
make your prediction? Can you base it on a poll taken the night before
the election?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">One-night polls are notoriously
inaccurate. They don't allow time for the callbacks needed to get the folks
who are not always at home. But you can plan a poll for three or four nights
that will end in time for publication the Sunday or even the Monday before
the election. By tracking the results of each night, you might pick up
on gross last-minute shifts, although you can't be sure because of sampling
variability <a name="230"></a> and unequal completion rates for each day. Finishing up on
a weekend is convenient because you can interview in the daytime to call
back people who could not be reached at night. A popular schedule in 1988
was to finish callbacks on Sunday afternoon, use the early evening hours
to do the final weighting and screening, and produce the final prediction
in time for Monday morning newspapers.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">What to report</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">A good reporter will give the numbers
for each stage of the process: the response to the straight voting intention
question, the response with leaners added, and the response with leaners
added and the undecided allocated. But which should be emphasized?</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The honest thing to do is to emphasize
the numbers that can be compared most directly to the election outcome,
i.e., the ones with leaners added and undecided allocated, the ones that
add to 100 percent. It is the only way to ensure full credit for being
accurate or full blame for getting it wrong. The Gallup Organization found
that out years ago. The Harris Poll does it that way. So does Gordon Black,
the pollster for <i>USA Today.</i> Some others don't. The next chapter
will explore their reasons and the consequences for precision journalism.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000" size="3">Election-night projections</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Election day opens a whole new world
of data collection possibilities. Newspapers and broadcasters alike have
an interest in detecting the outcome ahead of the official vote count.
The television networks try the hardest to do the most in this area, but
newspapers with early deadlines also have an interest in early detection.
There are two basic methods:</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">1. Projection from the early-reporting
precincts.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">2. Exit polls.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The first attempts of the networks
to do early projections on election night were primitive. In 1960, CBS
used a model based on the timing of the returns. At given intervals on
election night, the computer looked at the number of Republican <a name="231"></a> and Democratic
votes for president and compared them to the votes at the same time in
1956. On that basis, an early prediction was produced. It said Richard
M. Nixon would defeat John F. Kennedy.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">What the computer couldn't know
was where those votes were coming from. Kansas had introduced a faster
method of vote counting between 1956 and 1960, and so the votes from Republican
Kansas hit the wires at about the same time that Connecticut had come in
four years before. The error was corrected when more votes came in.<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-12" name="9return12">12</a></sup></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">A better way is to base the model
on geography. Pick either a random sample of precincts, which is the safest
way, or pick a sample that you know will report early. If the sample is
random, you can simply generalize from it to the whole electorate. If it
is purposeful, you will have to assume that it will deviate from the whole
in the same way that it did in the previous election.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><a NAME="abc231"></a><font size=+1>The method
works. On election night in 1976, I hung out at the ABC studio in New York
City, looking over the shoulder of David Neft, an associate of Louis Harris.
Neft had prepared a model based on early-reporting precincts. When the
first returns came in, I noticed that the turnout was less than in 1972
across a great variety of locations. Because 1972 had had the lowest voting
participation since 1948, I filed a story that said turnout in this election
was "the lowest in a generation."</font></font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">My bureau chief was upset. All the
wires were writing stories about what they perceived to <a name="232"></a>be a high turnout.
Some even talked about a record turnout. This is a common election-day
phenomenon. After covering the campaign for months, wire service reporters
have nothing to write about for the p.m. cycle on election day, so they
call up precinct officials and ask about the turnout. The officials look
out their windows, notice a long line, and say something like, "Wow, we've
got a really great turnout." What they forget to allow for is that the
previous election, with which they are making the mental comparison, was
not a presidential election. Also, the population has grown, so it takes
more bodies to equal the same percentage turnout. And, perhaps most important,
a high turnout makes their jobs seem more significant. I explained all
this, and my story was put on the wire. Most gratifying of all, the next
issue of <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> reproduced two sets of headlines
side by side. One set was from some Knight-Ridder papers with my low turnout
story. The other was from some bigger papers that went with the wire accounts
of the imagined heavy turnout. The final figure was 53.5 percent, compared
to 55.2 percent in 1972 and 60.9 percent in 1968. Not since the Truman-Dewey
contest of 1948 had it been so low.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Newspapers sometimes need the benefit
of election-night projections if they are in slow-reporting areas and have
early deadlines. Election night was a constant source of frustration for
the <i>Detroit Free Press</i> until Mike Maidenberg introduced an early-projection
system in 1969. Maidenberg, who later became a publisher, used a probability
sample of 20 out of Detroit's 1,111 precincts. That is not very many, but
he reduced the risk by stratifying on two dimensions.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Race was a factor in that election.
Richard Austin, a black candidate, was running against Sheriff Roman Gribbs.
Detroit had never had a black mayor before. To get good representation
of racial attitudes, Maidenberg drew the sample from a list that had been
divided into two groups, according to percentage of vote cast for George
Wallace in the 1968 presidential election. One group was above average
in Wallace support and the other was below.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Within each group, precincts were
ordered according to their historic Democratic strength. Maidenberg then
used a random start and a constant skip interval to draw the 20 precincts.
As a check, he compared the 20 precincts to the total for the 1968 election.
They were close, but not perfect. Abandoning science for art, he added
two black precincts to improve the model and used it in the 1969 primary
election for a toe-in-the-water, carefully hedged projection for use in
early editions. The highest error in any race was less than 2 percent.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Emboldened, Maidenberg revised the
model for the general election, using the primary as the benchmark. He
added three more precincts for a total of 25. It proved to be accurate <a name="233"></a>
within a percentage point. Some clerical errors made the lead of the winner,
Sheriff Roman Gribbs, seem larger than it was, so the <i>Free Press</i>
was bolder than it should have been that night. But the system quickly
became routinized. When the first black mayor was finally elected in Detroit --</font><font size="2">
</font><font size=+1>it
was Coleman Young --</font><font size="2"> </font><font size=+1>the fact that black precincts were the slowest to report
made the evening especially suspenseful. Kurt Luedtke was the executive
editor and Neal Shine was managing editor. The projections indicated Young
would win. Here is Shine's version of what happened next:</font></font>
  <blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">So Page One of the
late editions carried a headline declaring Young the winner, the story

uncounted precincts would sweep Young into office.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3">Then we repaired to
the London Chop House, where we took a series of calls from an increasingly
edgy news editor who told us that since it was well after midnight and

generations would tell about the night the careers of Luedtke and Shine
came crashing down while they nibbled eggs and drank champagne at the Chop.
But Young won, we kept our jobs. . . .<sup><a href="Chapter9.htm#9-13" name="9return13">13</a></sup></font>
  </blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Mike Maidenberg was not drinking
champagne that night. He took copies of the <i>Free Press</i> down to city
hall and passed them around. The election returns were being posted on
a blackboard. They showed Young losing. The members of the city hall crowd
looked at the blackboard, looked at the <i>Free Press</i> headline, and
scratched their heads. Then, as they held those papers in their hands,
the numbers on the board began to change. The black precincts came in,
Coleman won, and it almost looked like the <i>Free Press </i> had caused
it. "It was like magic," Maidenberg recalled.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">When Maidenberg left the <i>Free
Press,</i> he was succeeded in his election night role by Tim Kiska. Kiska
developed the <a name="234"></a> habit of buying a new suit to wear on each election day.
It made him seem more authoritative, he explained, when he had to convince
editors and writers of the right way to interpret his numbers. And if his
projection should turn out wrong, he would have a new suit to wear when
he went out hunting for another job.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><br>
<b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="3" color="#FF0000">Exit polls</font></b>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The networks now use a combination
of sample precincts and exit polls to do their early calls. Exit polls
have a nobler purpose, of course. They are excellent tools for assessing
the hidden forces in an election. By comparing issue preferences with candidate
choice, you can find out what campaign themes made the most difference.
If new coalitions are forming, you can identify them. And, since you already
know who won by the time you finish the analysis, you are not distracted
by the horse-race aspect.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">The methodology of an exit poll
is straightforward. Draw a random sample of precincts. Interview every
Nth voter coming out of those precincts, using a one-page (both sides),
self-administered questionnaire. Make sure the questionnaire has the words
"SECRET BALLOT" in 24-point type or larger at the top. Have each interviewer
carry a box with a slot in the top to hold the ballots. This kind of survey
has the following obvious advantages:</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">1. You know that your respondents
are voters, because you intercept them at the polling place.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">2. Nobody is undecided at that time.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">3. Sampling does not depend on households
or telephones. Your sample will therefore be the best evidence of the demographic
characteristics of the voters.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">And you have instant reassurance
that your sample is representative, because you can compare its election
decision to the election itself. In all of survey research, there is no
better external test of validity.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">There is, however, still the problem
of refusals. Exit polls, like telephone interviews, are refused by about
a third of those approached. Those who refuse generally do so because they
are in a hurry. Evidently, being in a hurry does not <a name="235"></a> correlate with voter
choice, because well-administered election polls are quite accurate.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Of course, like anything else, they
can be administered in a sloppy manner. Some exit pollsters sample day
parts as well as precincts. For example, Precinct A might be sampled from
8:00 to 10:00 and the interviewers then moved to Precinct B for sampling
from 11:00 to 1:00. That increases the number of precincts in the sample,
but it adds some administrative confusion. My own preference is to go with
as few as twenty-five precincts but keep the interviewers there all day
to ensure a good sample from each one.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Be sure to establish a procedure
that prevents the interviewers from selecting the respondents. Station
at least two interviewers at each place so that one can count off the voters
while another solicits the interviews. That way, the every Nth rule can
be enforced. If you let the interviewers choose the respondents, they will
pick people who look nice or friendly or sexy. Looking grubby or menacing
could well correlate with voter preference. That might explain why the <i>New York Times'</i> earliest attempts at exit polling in 1972 presidential
primaries turned up undercounts of voters for George Wallace, who was then
running on a segregation platform that appealed to poor whites.</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman">Short and simple questions work
best in the exit polls. An agree-disagree list can help sort respondents
into categories on a number of key issues in a hurry. Very simple multiple-choice
questions work well. A question on when the respondent made up his or her
mind on the main contest is a staple of most exit polls and helps explain
the dynamics of the campaign.&nbsp;</font>
<p style="line-height: 140%"><font size=+1 face="Times New Roman"> Some state legislatures have tried to stop
exit polls by banning interviews within some minimum distance from the
polling place. Such laws were found to be a violation of the First Amendment.
The attempt represents the surfacing of an uneasiness with precision journalism
and its fruits that will likely be seen again. The sources of that uneasiness
will be explored in the next chapter.&nbsp;</font>
