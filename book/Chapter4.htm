<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Most
news people and virtually all journalism students today have some familiarity
with computers. Their experience usually starts with word processing, either
on a mainframe editing system or on a personal computer. Many learn some
other application, such as a spreadsheet or a database. Your mental image
of a computer depends very much on the specific things you have done with
one. This chapter is designed to invite your attention to a very wide range
of possibilities for journalistic applications. As background for that
broad spectrum, we shall now indulge in a little bit of nostalgia.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Counting
and sorting</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Bob
Kotzbauer was the <i>Akron Beacon Journal</i>'s legislative reporter, and
I was its Washington correspondent. In the fall of 1962, Ben Maidenburg,
the executive editor, assigned us the task of driving around Ohio for two
weeks, knocking on doors and asking people how they would vote in the coming
election for governor. Because I had studied political science at Chapel
Hill, I felt sure that I knew how to do this chore. We devised a paper
form to record voter choices and certain other facts about each voter:
party affiliation, previous voting record, age, and occupation. The forms
were color coded: green for male voters, pink for females. We met many
interesting people and filed daily stories full of qualitative impressions
of the mood of the voters and descriptions of county fairs and autumn leaves.
After two weeks, we had&nbsp;<a NAME="77"></a>accumulated enough of the
pink and green forms to do the quantitative part. What happened next is
a little hazy in my mind after all these years, but it was something like
this:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Back
in Akron, we dumped the forms onto a table in the library and sorted them
into three stacks: previous Republican voters, Democratic voters, and non-voters.
That helped us gauge the validity of our sample. Then we divided each of
the three stacks into three more: voters for Mike DiSalle, the incumbent
Democrat, votes for James Rhodes, the Republican challenger, and undecided.
Nine stacks, now. We sorted each into two more piles, separating the pink
and green pieces of paper to break down the vote by sex. Eighteen stacks.
Sorting into four categories of age required dividing each of those eighteen
piles into four more, which would have made seventy-two. I don't remember
exactly how far we got before we gave up, exhausted and squinty-eyed. Our
final story said the voters were inscrutable, and the race was too close
to call.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
moral of this story is that before you embark on any complicated project
involving data analysis, you should look around first and see what technology
is available. There were no personal computers in 1962. Mainframe computing
was expensive and difficult, not at all accessible to newspaper reporters.
But there was in the <i>Beacon Journal</i> business office a machine that
would have saved us if we had known about it. The basic concept for it
had been developed nearly eighty years before by Dr. Herman Hollerith,
the father of modern computing.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Hollerith
was an assistant director of the United States Census at a time when the
census was in trouble. It took seven and a half years to tabulate the census
of 1880, and the country was growing so fast that it appeared that the
1890 census would not be finished when it was time for the census of 1900
to be well under way. Herman Hollerith saved the day by inventing the punched
card.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>It
was a simple three-by-five inch index card divided into quarter-inch squares.
Each square stood for one bit of binary information: a hole in the square
meant "yes" and no hole meant "no." All of the categories being tabulated
could fit on the card.&nbsp;<a NAME="78"></a>One group of squares, for
example, stood for age category in five-year segments. If you were 21 years
old on April 1, 1890, there would be a card for you, and the card would
have a hole punched in the 20-24 square.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Under
Hollerith's direction, a machine was built that could read 40 holes at
a time. The operator would slap a card down on its bed, and pull a lid
down over it. Tiny spikes would stop when they encountered a solid portion
of the card and pass through where they encountered holes. Below each spike
was a cup of mercury. When the spike touched the mercury, an electrical
contact was completed causing a counter on the vertical face of the machine
to advance one notch. This machine was called the Tabulator.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There
was more. Hollerith invented a companion machine, called the Sorter, which
was wired into the same circuit. It had compartments corresponding to the
dials on the Tabulator, each with its own little door. The same electrical
contact that advanced a dial on the Tabulator caused a door on the Sorter
to fly open so that the operator could drop the tallied card into it. A
clerk could take the cards for a whole census tract, sort them by age in
this manner, and then sort each stack by gender to create a table of age
by sex distribution for the tract. Hollerith was so pleased with his inventions
that he left the Bureau and founded his own company to bid on the tabulation
contract for the 1890 census. His bid was successful, and he did the job
in two years, even though the population had increased by 25 percent since
1880.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Improvements
on the system began almost immediately. Hollerith won the contract for
the 1900 census, but then the Bureau assigned one of its employees, James
Powers, to develop its own version of the punched-card machine. Like Hollerith,
Powers eventually left to start his own company. The two men squabbled
over patents and eventually each sold out. Powers's firm was absorbed by
a component of what would eventually become Sperry Univac, and Hollerith's
was folded into what finally became IBM. By 1962, when Kotzbauer and I
were sweating over those five hundred scraps of paper, the <i>Beacon Journal</i>
had, unknown to us, an IBM counter-sorter which was the great grandchild
of those&nbsp;<a NAME="79"></a>early machines. It used wire brushes touching
a copper roller instead of spikes and mercury, and it sorted 650 cards
per minute, and it was obsolete before we found out about it.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>By
that time, the Hollerith card, as it was still called, had smaller holes
arranged in 80 columns and 12 rows. That 80-column format is still found
in many computer applications, simply because data archivists got in the
habit of using 80 columns and never found a reason to change even after
computers permitted much longer records. I can understand that. The punched
card had a certain concreteness about it, and, to this day, when trying
to understand a complicated record layout in a magnetic storage medium
I find that it helps if I visualize those Hollerith cards with the little
holes in them.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Computer
historians have been at a loss to figure out where Hollerith got the punched-card
idea. One story holds that it came to him when he watched a railway conductor
punching tickets. Other historians note that the application of the concept
goes back at least to the Jacquard loom, built in France in the early 1800s.
Wire hooks passed through holes in punched cards to pick up threads to
form the pattern. The player piano, patented in 1876, used the same principle.
A hole in a given place in the roll means hit a particular key at a particular
time and for a particular duration; no hole means don't hit it. Any piano
composition can be reduced to those binary signals.<a NAME="4return1" href="Chapter4.htm#4-1"></a><sup><a href="Chapter4.htm#4-1" name="4return1">1</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>From
counting and sorting, the next step is performing mathematical calculations
in a series of steps on encoded data. These steps require the basic pieces
of modern computer hardware: a device to store data and instructions, machinery
for doing the arithmetic, and something to manage the traffic as raw information
goes in and processed data come out. J. H. Muller, a German, designed such
a machine in 1786, but lacked the technology to build it. British Mathematician
Charles Babbage tried to build one starting in 1812. He, too, was ahead
of the available technology. In 1936, when Howard Aiken started planning
the Mark I computer at Harvard, he found that Babbage had anticipated many
of his ideas. Babbage, for example, foresaw the need to provide "a store"
in which raw data and results are kept and "a mill"&nbsp;<a NAME="80"></a>where
the computations take place.<a NAME="4return2" href="Chapter4.htm#4-2"></a><sup><a href="Chapter4.htm#4-2" name="4return2">2</a></sup>
Babbage's store and mill are today called "memory" and "central processing
unit" or CPU. The machine Babbage envisioned would have been driven by
steam. Although the Mark I used electrical relays, it was basically a mechanical
device. Electricity turned the switches on and off, and the on-off condition
held the binary information. It generated much heat and noise. Pieces of
it were still on display at the Harvard Computation Center when I was last
there in 1968.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Mark
I and Aiken served in the Navy toward the end of World War II, working
on ballistics problems. This was the project that got Grace Murray Hopper
started in the computer business. Then a young naval officer, she rose
to the rank of admiral and contributed some key concepts to the development
of computers along the way.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Parallel
work was going on under sponsorship of the Army, which also needed complicated
ballistics problems worked out. A machine called ENIAC, which used vacuum
tubes, resistors, and capacitors instead of mechanical relays, was begun
for the Army at the University of Pennsylvania, based in part on ideas
used in a simpler device built earlier at Iowa State University by John
Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate assistant, Clifford E. Berry. The land-grant
college computer builders did not bother to patent their work; it was put
aside during World War II, and the machine was cannibalized for parts.
The Ivy League inventors were content to take the credit until the Atanasoff-Berry
Computer, or ABC machine, as it came to be known, was rediscovered in a
1973 patent suit between two corporate giants. Sperry Rand Corp., then
owner of the ENIAC patent, was challenged by Honeywell, Inc., which objected
to paying royalties to Sperry Rand. The Honeywell people tracked down the
Atanasoff-Berry story, and a federal district judge ruled that the ENIAC
was derived from Atanasoff's work and was therefore not patentable. That's
how Atanasoff, a theoretical physicist who only wanted a speedy way to
solve simultaneous equations, became recognized as the father of the modern
computer. The key ideas were the use of electronic rather than mechanical
switches, the use of binary numbers, and the use of logic&nbsp;<a NAME="81"></a>circuits
rather than direct counting to manipulate those binary numbers. These ideas
came to the professor while having a drink in an Iowa roadhouse in the
winter of 1937, and he built his machine for $6,000.<a NAME="4return3" href="Chapter4.htm#4-3"></a><sup><a href="Chapter4.htm#4-3" name="4return3">3</a></sup></font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>ENIAC,
on the other hand, cost $487,000. It was not completed in time to aid the
war effort, but once turned on in February 1946, it lasted for nearly ten
years, demonstrating the reliability of electronic computing, and paved
the way for the postwar developments. Its imposing appearance, banks and
banks of wires, dials, and switches, still influences cartoon views of
computers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Once
the basic principles had been established in the 1940s, the problems became
those of refining the machinery (the hardware) and developing the programming
(the software) to control it. By the 1990s, a look backward saw three distinct
phases in computing machinery, based on the primary electronic device that
did the work:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>First
generation: vacuum tubes (ENIAC, UNIVAC)</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>Second
generation: transistors (IBM 7090)</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>Third
generation: integrated circuits (IBM 360 series)</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Transistors
are better than tubes because they are cheaper, more reliable, smaller,
faster, and generate less heat. Integrated circuits are built on tiny solid-state
chips that combine many transistors in a very small space. How small? Well,
all of the computing power of the IBM 7090, which filled a good-sized room
when I was introduced to it at Harvard in 1966, is now packed into a chip
the size of my fingernail. How do they make such complicated things so
small? By way of a photo-engraving process. The circuits are designed on
paper, photographed so that a lens reduces the image -- just the way your
camera reduces the image of your house to fit on a frame of 35 mm. film
-- and etched on layers of silicon.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>As
computers got better, they got cheaper, but one more thing had to happen
before their use could extend to the everyday life of such nonspecialists
as journalists. They had to be made easy to use. That is where Admiral
Grace Murray Hopper earned her place in computer history. (One of her contributions
was being the first person to debug a computer: when the Mark I broke down
one day in 1945, she traced the&nbsp;<a NAME="82"></a>problem to a dead
moth caught in a relay switch.) She became the first person to build an
entire career on computer programming. Perhaps her most important contribution,
in 1952, was her development of the first assembly language.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To
appreciate the importance of that development, think about a computer doing
all its work in binary arithmetic. Binary arithmetic represents all numbers
with combinations of zeros and ones. To do its work, the computer has to
receive its instructions in binary form. This fact of life limited the
use of computers to people who had the patience, brain power, and attention
span to think in binary. Hopper quickly realized that computers were not
going to be useful to large numbers of people so long as that was the case,
and so she wrote an assembly language. An assembly language assembles groups
of binary machine language statements into the most frequently used operations
and lets the user invoke them by working in a simpler language that uses
mnemonic codes to make the instructions easy to remember. The user writes
the program in the assembly language and the software converts each assembler
statement into the corresponding machine language statements -- all "transparently"
or out of sight of the user -- and the computer does what it is told just
as if it had been given the orders in its own machine language. That was
such a good idea that it soon led to yet another layer of computer languages
called compilers. The assembly languages were machine-specific; the compilers
were written so that once you learned one you could use it on different
machines. The compilers were designed for specialized applications. FORTRAN
(for formula translator) was designed for scientists, and more than thirty
years and many technological changes later is still a standard. COBOL (for
common business oriented language) was produced, under the prodding of
Admiral Hopper, and is today the world standard for business applications.
BASIC (for beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code) was created
at Dartmouth College to provide an easy language for students to begin
on. It is now standard for personal computers.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To
these three layers -- machine language, assembler, and compiler -- has
been added yet a fourth layer. Higher-level&nbsp;<a NAME="83"></a>special
purpose languages are easy to use and highly specialized. They group compiler
programs and let the user invoke them in a way that is almost like talking
to the computer in plain English. For statistical applications, the two
world leaders are SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) and
SAS (Statistical Analysis System). If you are going to do extensive analysis
of computer databases, sooner or later you will probably want to learn
one or both of these two higher-level languages. Here is an example that
will show you why:</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You
have a database that lists every honorarium reported by every member of
Congress for a given year. The first thing you want to know is the central
tendency, so you write a program to give you the mean, the variance, and
the standard deviation. A FORTRAN program would require 22 steps. In SAS,
once the data have been described to the computer, there are just three
lines of code. In SPSS there is only one:&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
a comparative evaluation of SAS and SPSS, keep reading. But first there
is&nbsp;<a NAME="84"></a>one other kind of software you need to know about.
Every computer needs a system for controlling its activity, directing instructions
to the proper resources. Starting with the first of the third-generation
IBM mainframe computers, the language enabling the user to control the
operating system was called JCL for Job Control Language. Now "job control
language" has become a generic term to mean the language used to run any
operating system. (On second-generation mainframes, which could only work
on one job at a time, we filled out a pencil-and-paper form telling the
computer operator what tapes to mount on what drives and what switches
to hit.) The operating systems also include some utility programs that
let you do useful things with data like sorting, copying, protecting, and
merging files.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>One
other kind of software is needed for batch computing. If you are going
to send the computer a list of instructions, you need a system for entering
and editing those instructions. Throughout the 1960s and part of the 1970s,
instructions were entered on punched cards. You typed the instructions
at a card-punching machine and edited them by throwing away the cards with
mistakes and substituting good ones. Today the instructions are entered
directly into computer memory and edited there. Older editing systems still
in use are TSO (for time-sharing option) and WYLBUR (named to make it seem
human). XEDIT is a powerful and more recent IBM editor. If you do mainframe
computing, you will have to learn one of the editor systems available for
that particular mainframe. Personal computer programs that allow batch
processing have their own built-in editors, and you can learn them at the
same time you learn the underlying program. You can also use the word-processing
program with which you are most familiar to write and edit computer programs.&nbsp;</font></font>

<div style="line-height: 140%"></div>

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Computers
today</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
first decision to make when approaching a task that needs a computer is
whether to do the job on a mainframe or on a personal computer. The second
is what software to use. Software can generally be classified into two
kinds: that which operates interactively, generally by presenting you with
choices from a menu and responding to your choices, and that which operates
in batch mode, where you present a complete list of instructions and get
back a complete job. Some statistical packages offer aspects of both.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
threshold of size and complexity at which you need a mainframe keeps getting
pushed back. As recently as the early 1980s, a mainframe would routinely
be used to analyze a simple public opinion survey with, say, 50 questions
and 1,500 respondents. By the late 1980s, personal computers powerful enough
to do that job more conveniently were commonplace in both homes and offices.
By 1989, <i>USA Today </i>had begun to work with very powerful personal
computers to read and analyze large federal government computer archives
in its own special projects office. Mainframes were still needed for the&nbsp;<a NAME="856"></a>larger
and more complex databases, but it seems likely that mainframes could become
irrelevant for most journalistic work at some point during the shelf life
of this book.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>After
word processing, the most common personal computer applications are spreadsheets
and database programs. The best way to get to know a spreadsheet (examples:
Lotus, SuperCalc, PC-Calc) is to use one as your personal check register.
As a journalist or potential journalist, you are probably more comfortable
with words than numbers and don't get your checkbook to balance very often.
A spreadsheet will make it possible and may even encourage you to seek
out more complicated applications. For example, when Tom Moore was in the
Knight-Ridder Washington Bureau, he created a spreadsheet model for a hypothetical

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>To
understand what a database program (examples: dBase, Paradox, PC-File,
Q &amp; A) is good for, imagine a project requiring data stored on index
cards. The school insurance investigation described in chapter 2 is a good
example. A database program will sort things for you and search for specific
things or specific relationships. One thing it is especially good for is
maintaining the respondent list for a mail survey, keeping track of who
has answered, and directing follow-up messages to those who have not. A
database system is better at information retrieval than it is at systematic
analysis of the information, but many reporters have used such systems
for fairly sophisticated analysis.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Those
who design computer software and those who decide what software to use
have difficult choices to make. Life is a tradeoff. The easier software
is to learn and use, the less flexible it is. The only way to gain flexibility
is to work harder at learning it in the first place. It is not the function
of this book to teach you computer programming, but to give you a general
idea of how things work. To do that, this next section is going to walk
you through a simple example using SPSS Studentware, a program that is
cheap and reliable and achieves a nice balance between flexibility and
ease of use.</font></font>

is a national newspaper (I define it as a national newspaper if it is published
outside North Carolina, and I can buy it on a newsstand in Chapel Hill)

not. Here is what the complete database looks like:</font></font>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Before
we do anything with it, let's visualize a couple of concepts. In dealing
with any set of data, the first thing you need to know is what the unit
of analysis is. In this case, the unit is the individual newspaper. Each
line in the data is a <i>unit of analysis.</i> Another word for it is <i>observation,</i>
which is the term used in SAS manuals. Yet another is <i>case,</i> a term
preferred by the writers of SPSS instructions. Each case or observation
in the example above is one line or <i>record,</i> to use a common data-processing
term. In a larger data set, you might have more than one record per case.
When data were entered on punched cards, the standard record length was
80 characters, which was the width of the standard Hollerith card. Now
your data entry medium is more likely to be a magnetic tape or disk, and
there is less restriction on record length and therefore less need to have
more than one record per case. However, 80 characters is still a good length
if you&nbsp;<a NAME="87"></a>are likely to want to look at your data on
a computer screen. The typical word processor shows an 80-character screen,
and if you have to edit the data, the word processor with which you are
most familiar can be the best way to do it. Another practical length is
132 characters, the number that will fit on a wide-carriage printer.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If
you have trouble picturing the concepts of "record" and "unit of analysis,"
imagine that your data are entered on three-by-five index cards. Each card
is a record. What does each card stand for? Is it a person, as in a public
opinion poll? A political contribution? A piece of real estate? Whatever
it is, that is your unit of analysis (or "case" if you are using SPSS,
"observation" if you are dealing with SAS).</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Here
are some other things worth noticing about the simple data set in our example.
The identity of each case comes first, and the newspaper names have been
compressed to six-character mnemonics. It would be perfectly okay to list
the name in full. However, that might take some extra programming because
many analysis programs set limits on the length of non-numeric fields that
they can handle. Six or eight characters is usually safe. In this data
set, we have four <i>fields. </i>The first is <i>alphanumeric,</i> and
the other three are <i>numeric.</i> Computers are better at manipulating
numeric data and, where we have a choice, we usually prefer all numbers.
An identification field is not used for manipulation, as a rule, and so
we don't mind not having numbers there.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Another
thing to note about this data set is that it is in <i>fixed format.</i>
In other words, each field of data lines up (with right justification)
vertically. If we think of the character fields as vertical columns, the
identification always occupies columns 1 through 6, circulation size is
in 8 through 14, prior circulation is in locations 16 through 22, and so
forth. Some analysis systems, including both SAS and SPSS, are so forgiving
that they don't require this much attention to "a place for everything
and everything in its place." They can be made to recognize variables just
by the order in which they appear, provided they are <i>delimited.</i>
The data in our example are delimited by spaces, meaning there is a space
to tell the computer where one field stops and another begins. In some&nbsp;<a NAME="88"></a>situations,
it is better to use commas or other characters as delimiters. In the old
punched-card days, delimiters were not used as much because of the limited
space. We liked to cram the fields together, cheek to cheek. With delimiters,
your data are easier for humans to read, even if the computer doesn't care.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Now
think for a moment about what we might want to do with this data set. One
obvious thing is to calculate a mean and a standard deviation for each
circulation year. That way, we can see if the ten largest papers as a whole
have been declining or growing in circulation. (Eyeball inspection of the
list shows there are examples of both.) We would also be interested in
knowing the growth or decline rate for each paper over the five-year period.
Here is the entire SPSS program for doing all of that. The program would
be the same whether we were dealing with ten newspapers or 10,000.</font></font>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Only
four statements. No more. Here's what they do:</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
DATA LIST. This is a format statement. It tells SPSS to look in its own
directory for the file named "PAPER.DOC." How did the file get there? I
put it there with my word processor. It then tells SPSS that the first
variable is named ID, that it is found in positions 1 through 6 and that
it is alphanumeric rather than numeric (the default). Then each of the
other variables is named and its location given.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2.</b> <font size=+1>COMPUTE.
This is a powerful SPSS command for making new variables out of old ones.
This particular statement says that, for each case, subtract the old circulation
from the new and divide the result by the old. That, of course, yields
the percent change from 1983 to 1988. The command further tells SPSS to
assign the resulting value to a new variable named GROWTH.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>3.
FREQUENCIES. This simple command tells SPSS to report the frequency of
each occurrence of each value for&nbsp;<a NAME="89"></a>each variable in
three ways; absolute terms, simple percent, and cumulative percent. The
STATISTICS option further orders the mean, median, standard deviation,
and range for each variable.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>4.
LIST is asking for a simple report showing the five-year circulation shift
for each newspaper.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
total output from these four simple commands is three pages long. The important
part can be summarized quite succinctly. The mean circulation for these
ten papers rose from 932,165 to 1,022,786 over the five-year period. To
see which grew and which shrank, here is a direct quote from the SPSS output:&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;

to do some real analysis. Which papers have experienced the most growth,
national or local, northeast or elsewhere? There are at least two convenient

is to reduce the GROWTH variable itself to categorical status and run a
crosstab. To do that, we'll take the top five on the list and call them

low growth. The SPSS code to do that (and introduce some labels on the
output to make the tables easy to read) is as follows:</font></font></div>

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>SPSS
and SAS compared</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Both
SAS and SPSS have been around for a long time. My first encounter with
such user-oriented, higher-level languages was at Harvard in 1966, where
faculty members in the department of social relations had written a language
called DATA-TEXT for Harvard's IBM 7090.<a NAME="4return4" href="Chapter4.htm#4-4"></a><sup><a href="Chapter4.htm#4-4" name="4return4">4</a></sup>
They worked on a government grant and gave the product away to anyone for
the cost of a blank tape, then about $10. It never really caught on because,
to make it fast and efficient, they wrote it mostly in the 7090's assembler
language. That meant that when the third generation of computers came along
it could not be quickly adapted. By the time the Harvard folks got around
to it, SPSS, written in FORTRAN and therefore readily transportable, had
passed them in popularity. Today, SPSS is a booming business, based in
Chicago, the academic home base of Norman Nie, its chief founder. SAS,
meanwhile, based in Cary, North Carolina, became the chief rival to SPSS.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Both
systems are constantly being improved and expanded, and so any comparison
between them risks becoming quickly outdated. However, as late as 1990,
there were fundamental differences in approach traceable to the respective
corporate cultures of SAS and SPSS, which did not seem likely to change
over time.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>SAS
was more of a programmer's system, SPSS was better suited to the nonprogrammer.
In the tradeoff between flexibility and ease of use, SAS leaned a little
more toward flexibility. If you were going to analyze data often, that
is, more than two or three times a year, it could be worth the trouble
to master SAS. With SPSS you did not have to think like a programmer. Some
steps that SAS kept visible in order to force you to understand what was
happening in the computer were made transparent by SPSS. This was particularly
true where crosstabs were concerned. Labeling and setting up tables was
much easier in SPSS.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="93"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>SAS
justly gained fame for its file management capabilities. If you had large
and complicated bodies of data to work with on a mainframe, SAS was great
at letting you reshape them and get them into workable form. Both SAS and
SPSS were, by the late 1980s, capable of reading complicated formats, some
of which will be discussed shortly.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
weakest point for SAS was its manuals. Those produced in the 1980s were
written by programmers for programmers, and, until you learned to think
like a computer programmer, they were hard to read. The SAS folks cranked
them out so fast that they sometimes did not get them organized well. An
early introduction to SAS-PC, for example, told you clearly, with four-color
illustrations, how to save a program file, but it never mentioned how to
retrieve it once it was saved. SPSS manuals were more readable. Best of
all, SPSS had Marija Norusis, the clearest writer on computing and statistical
method I have ever encountered. Norusis has produced a series of books
for SPSS which integrate the explanation of computer technique and statistical
method, which is the logical way to learn this stuff.<a NAME="4return5" href="Chapter4.htm#4-5"></a><sup><a href="Chapter4.htm#4-5" name="4return5">5</a></sup>
It lets you mix learning and doing in a way that constantly rewards your
efforts.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
their PC versions, SAS and SPSS designed very different editors, the systems
that let you prepare your batch instructions. The SPSS editor was combined
with a menu system. This is good news for personal computer users who are
likely to be accustomed to menus, but SPSS, like SAS, is meant for batch
mode. Most newcomers to SPSS used the menus like training wheels and bypassed
them for direct entry as soon as possible. The SAS editor, called "Display
Manager," was more logical and easier to learn than the SPSS version. It
gave you three screens: one for your batch program, one for the output,
and one for the log that recorded the good or bad things that happened
to your program, including the error messages. One key let you toggle between
the three screens, and another key let you zoom any of them up to a full
screen so you could concentrate on its contents. Not content with that,
and perhaps not wanting to be outdone by SPSS, SAS in 1989 offered a menu-driven
version to appeal to potential users who felt the need for training wheels.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><a NAME="94"></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Both
SAS and SPSS had only minor differences in their mainframe and PC languages.
After learning one, you could easily switch to the other. Starting in 1988,
I stopped introducing students to the mainframe and let them learn first
on the PC because the feedback is faster and the student has a greater
sense of control. Both SAS and SPSS had systems for exporting their system
files -- files with the format and label instructions already carried out
-- between mainframes and PCs. And at the mainframe level, SPSS and SAS
could read each other's system files, a clever move designed to encourage
users of one to switch to the other without worrying about losing the value
of their existing data libraries.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
SAS v. SPSS story is a fine example of the power of competition in a free
market system. Each keeps trying to outdo the other. Many users, afraid
of being left behind in some new development, maintain a bilingual capability.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<div style="line-height: 140%"></div>&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Complex
databases</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>A
database that follows the model of the ten largest newspapers used earlier
in this chapter is straightforward and easy to work with no matter how
large it gets. If we had 2,000 newspapers and 2,000 variables (4 million
pieces of information), the logic and the programming would be exactly
the same as we used with ten papers and five variables. Such a database
is called <i>rectangular.</i> Every case has the same number of records
and the same number of variables.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>There
are two fairly common types of nonrectangular files:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>1.
Files with different numbers of records per case.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>2.
Files that are <i>hierarchical</i> or nested.</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>In
the first of these two cases, a file can be treated as if it were rectangular
with the variables that would have been in the missing records defined
as "missing." Both SAS and SPSS provide for automatic treatment of missing
values. When calculating percentages, for example, they use the number
of nonmissing values as the base. For example, if you had a file describing
the 83 residents of a dormitory, and if 40 were classified as males, 40
as females, and the gender of three was unknown, either system would report
50 percent&nbsp;<a NAME="95"></a>males and 50 percent females unless you
specified missing as a separate category.&nbsp;</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>But
sometimes an unequal number of records does not denote missing values.
It may just mean different quantities of whatever is being measured. A
hierarchical file is one way of dealing with this situation. Suppose the
government created a computer file based on reports filed by manufacturing
companies on their disposition of toxic waste. The unit of analysis (or
case or observation) would be a single plant. Then there might be one record
for each toxic chemical emitted, with each record showing how much of the
chemical was discharged in each of several sectors of the environment,
e.g., land, water, air, or recycling facility. A plant that dumped a lot
of different chemicals would have more records per case than a plant that
dumped a few. Both SAS and SPSS are equipped to handle this situation.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Let's
complicate this example a little bit more. Suppose there is one report
for each corporate entity that emits toxic waste. The first record in each
case would have information about the corporation, it size, location of
headquarters, industrial classification, and so on. Call this Record Type
1.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
each of these corporate records, there is a set of plant records, one for
each plant. This would be Record Type 2, and it would contain information
about the plant, including geographic location, size, product line, etc.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>For
each plant record, there would be yet another set of records (Type 3),
one for each toxic chemical discharged. Each of these records would give
the generic name for the chemical, any trade names, the amount, an indication
of its form (gas, liquid, or solid).</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Finally,
for each chemical record, envision one more set (Type 4), one for each
method of disposal used for that particular chemical, i.e., ground, water,
air, recycling. Each of these records could give details on the time, place,
and manner of each emission.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>If
all of that sounds complicated, it is because it is. However, there is
some good news here. The good news is that a flexible analysis package
like SAS or SPSS can deal with this&nbsp;<a NAME="96"></a>kind of file,
and, even better, it can let you choose the unit of analysis.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Hierarchical
files are created by people who don't have the slightest idea what the
analyst will eventually be interested in, and so the files are designed
to leave all possibilities open. The advantage is that you can set your
unit of analysis at any level in the hierarchy. Suppose, for example, you
want the individual plant to be the unit of analysis. The computer can
spread the corporate data across all of the plant cases so that you can
use the corporate variables in comparing the characteristics of different
plants. Or if you want the individual chemical emission to be the unit
of analysis, you can tell the computer to spread the corporate and plant
data to cover each emission. You do that by creating a rectangular file
first. After that, the rest of the analysis is straightforward.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Communication
among computers</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Twenty
years ago, the first law of computers seemed to be "Everything is incompatible."
Today, compatibility is usually close at hand.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>While
computers use binary formats to hold and process information, there are
a number of possible ways to do it. The smallest unit of information is
the binary "bit," meaning one piece of on-off, yes-no, open-closed information.
By stringing several bits together, one can encode more complicated pieces
of information, and the standard convention is to string them together
in groups of eight. Each group of eight is called a "byte." When a computer
manufacturer tells you that a machine has 512K of random access memory,
it means 512 kilobytes or 512,000 bytes. A byte is also the equivalent
of a letter, number, or special character on the keyboard. For example
in the Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC), standard
on IBM mainframes, the eight-bit expression 11010111 stands for the letter
"P." Another coding system, the American Standard Code for Information
Exchange (ASCII), is used on most personal computers. Right there you can
sense some problems if you try to move data from one kind of computer to
another, but they have been mostly anticipated by the designers of the
communication&nbsp;<a NAME="97"></a>equipment. If you move data between
a mainframe and a personal computer, the communication software takes care
of the ASCII-EBCDIC conversion, and you seldom have to be aware of the
difference.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>How
do you get data from one place to another? The telephone is convenient
for data sets that are not too large. Their speeds are measured in <i>baud</i>
rates, after the Baudot code. Low-priced modems in 1989 operated at 1,200
baud, which is about 120 characters per second or 1,200 words per minute--more
than most people's comfortable reading speed. More expensive equipment
was capable of 9,600 baud. Even so, for very large data sets to be moved
across phone lines takes a considerable amount of time, and there were
still situations where it was more convenient to move data from one place
to another by physically carrying it in a magnetic or optical medium. A
development that helped some news organizations was the availability of
a desktop tape drive that could transfer the contents of a tape written
on a mainframe to a personal computer. <i>USA Today</i> installed one in
1989. A <i>local area network,</i> or LAN, provides a means of moving data
among computers over short distances.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Dealing
with large government databases usually means having to work with tapes
unless you can talk the governmental unit into copying the material onto
personal computer disks. Tapes are more complicated than disks only because
there are more ways to store data on them.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>When
you tackle a tape data set for the first time, you will probably be working
with a mainframe, and you can expect help from the computer professionals
at the mainframe installation. If you have a good description of the tape,
that person can put together the job control language (JCL) to read it
and boot SAS or SPSS. You don't have to learn to do everything yourself,
at least not all at once. But you will find it easier to communicate with
the pros if you know the following facts about how tape data sets are constructed.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<div style="line-height: 140%"></div>

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Tape
facts</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
data are stored on tracks which run the length of the tape. Nine-track
is the standard IBM format, but some&nbsp;<a NAME="98"></a>systems still
use seven tracks. Before a tape can be written on for the first time, it
has to be <i>initialized,</i> which usually means giving it an internal,
machine-readable label and specifying a density range. The most common
density levels are 1,600 and 6,250 bytes per inch (BPI). The key variables
for the data layout are logical record length (LRECL in job control language)
and block size (BLKSIZE). Because a tape drive reads the data sequentially,
spooling through the tape from the beginning to find what it is told to
look for, it pays to pack the records in cheek-to-cheek to reduce the distance
the tape has to travel, and so the records are "blocked." If a tape has
an LRECL of 80 and BLKSIZE of 80, each logical record is its own block,
and the data are said to be in "card image," because the physical records
are analogous to a deck of old-fashioned Hollerith cards. You will also
need to specify the record format (RECFM), which is usually FB for fixed
format (i.e., each record is the same length), and the records are arranged
in blocks. These characteristics are all specified on a JCL statement that
describes the Data Control Block (DCB). Many different data sets can be
kept on one tape. You might store a dozen public opinion polls on one tape,
for example. To keep track of them, the computer leaves an end-of-file
(EOF) marker at the end of each data set that it writes. To get back to
that same data set, you just specify its sequence number in the JCL statement.
Two EOF marks together constitute the end-of-tape signal. It helps to keep
the tape from running off the reel and flopping foolishly around.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Good
news for IBM users: when you use an IBM standard label tape, you can often
ignore most of the DCB business because it is contained in the tape's own
internal label and your computer software will read it and adjust things
for you. Here is an example of a JCL data definition statement for reading
a standard label tape:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>//INPUT
DD DSN=TUCIRSS.ROPER.GSS7288.SPSSX,</font></font></div>

<br><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LABEL=(1,SL),
VOL=SER=UDL393,DISP=OLD,</font></font>
<br><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNIT=TAPE</font></font></blockquote>

<div style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>The
two slashes tell the computer that it is reading job control language.
INPUT DD means that it is about to&nbsp;<a NAME="99"></a>receive the data
definition for an incoming file. The four strings of characters separated
by periods are the tape's internal, machine-read label. LABEL=(1,SL) means
that this is an IBM standard label tape, and the machine is to read the
first file on the tape. UDL393 is the external label on the tape. A human
being has to locate it by that label, pick it off a shelf, and mount it
on a tape drive. If this were not a standard label tape, or if you were
uncertain, you could bypass the label processing and spell out the DCB
characteristics in that same statement.</font></font></div>


<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Sometimes
very large data sets, especially those prepared by or for the federal government,
use some special coding systems designed to save space. They use hexadecimal
or zoned decimal or packed decimal notation. Not to worry. Both SAS and
SPSS have provisions to allow you to warn the computer in the input statement
to watch out for that stuff. As long as you tell the computer what to expect,
there is no problem, and the output will show the conventional numbers
you want.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Data
formats are more standardized in a personal computer, and you seldom have
to worry about the details of how information is laid out on a disk. But
you will want to keep an operating system manual handy, for its utilities
if for nothing else. The companies that write operating system software
tend to issue manuals that are compulsive in their completeness. This makes
them hard to read. Browse in the computer department of a good bookstore
until you find a manual by an independent author that is pitched at your
level. Microsoft DOS (for Disk Operating System) was the standard for IBM
and compatible computers throughout the 1980s. A newer system, OS/2, was
designed to allow more efficient use of resources by permitting a personal
computer to work on more than one task at once.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Data
entry</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>How
do data get onto the tape or disk medium in the first place? Someone types
them in. When you have data that you generated yourself, through a survey,
field experiment, or coding from public records, you can type it in yourself,
using&nbsp;<a NAME="100"></a>your favorite word processor, especially if
you have a word processor that keeps track of the columns for you so that
you can be sure that each entry in a fixed format is going to the right
place. Save it in ASCII code, unformatted, and read it directly on a personal
computer or upload it through a modem to a mainframe. For any but small-scale
projects, however, it is better to send the data to a professional data
entry house. The pros can do it faster and with fewer errors than you can.
Normally, data entry suppliers verify each entry by having it done twice,
with a computer checking to make certain that each operator read the material
the same way. A variety of optical character readers is also available
to machine-read printed or typed materials or special pencil-and-paper
forms.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><b><font face="arial, helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>The
nerd factor</font></font></font></b>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Computers
are so fascinating in and of themselves that it is easy to get so absorbed
in the minutia of their operation that you forget what you started to use
the computer for in the first place. The seductive thing about the computer
is that it presents many interesting puzzles for which there is always
an answer. And if you work with it long enough and hard enough, it will
always reward you.</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Most
of life is not that way. Rewards are uncertain; you never have complete
control. And so it becomes tempting to concentrate on the area where you
do have control, the computer and its contents, to the exclusion of everything
else. Neither academics nor journalists can afford to become that narrow.
The computer needs to be kept in its place: as a tool to help you toward
a goal, not as the goal itself.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p style="line-height: 140%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>You
can't learn everything there is to know about computers, but you can learn
what you need to know to get the story. You will find that concepts and
procedures that you do not use more than once are quickly forgotten, and
that you will build two kinds of knowledge: things you need to know and
do yourself, and things for which you can find ready help when you need
it. Be a journalist first, and don't use the computer to shut out the world.</font></font>
