<font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>Research
on public journalism at Chapel Hill</font></font></font></h3>
<font face="Times New Roman">Because public journalism had never been clearly
defined, not even by its inventors, the first step in the research process
was to discover what it was. We set the following goals:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1</font></b><font color="#0000FF">.</font>
Define public journalism in terms of the culture of the newsrooms claiming
to practice it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">2</font></b><font color="#0000FF">.</font>
Define public journlism in terms of the manifest differences it makes in
media content.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">3.</font></b>
Discover the effects, if any, on the attitudes and knowledge of citizens
in the communities whose media practice public journalism.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">4</font></b><font color="#0000FF">.</font>
Find the effects, if any, on the civic participation of those citizens.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">5.</font></b>
Learn how public journalism might be made more effective.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Our research program, with funding from
the Knight Chair, The Poynter Institute for Media Studies, and The Pew
Center for Civic Journalism, has followed this plan, and a body of knowledge
about the10-year-old movement is begining to emerge. Highlights in rough
chronological order:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1993:</font></b><font color="#FF0000">
</font>Phil Meyer analyzed public journalism in the national elections
of 1992 for a chapter in Michael Nelson, Ed., The Elections of 1992, Congressional
Quarterly, 1993. It was titled "The Media Reformation: Giving the Agenda
Back to the People" and cited the work of several of his students.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1995:</font></b><font color="#0000FF">
</font>Carol Dykers completed her dissertation, "Making Journalism Public:
a Case Study of Change at the Wichita Eagle."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1995:</font></b>
John Bare's dissertation, Toward a Definition of Public Journalism, was
the first successful attempt to give the abstract concept of public journalism
an empirical definition. Through survey research in three newsrooms, Bare
identified basic differences in values that set the staff members at the
Wichita Eagle, the birthplace of public journalism, apart from their peers
at more traditional newspapers. The Wichita staffers felt more connected
to their community and a greater desire to use the power of the newspaper
to help citizens work out solutions to common problems.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1995:</font></b>
Some of the reflexive opposition to public journalism came from investigative
reporters who cherish the values of fact-finding and objectivity. Phil
Meyer traveled to an IRE meeting in Cleveland to argue that public journalism
increases the need for sound investigative work. His talk is "<a href="ire95pj.htm">Public
Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity</a>."</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1996:</font></b>
Ken Blake, using data collected by Phil Meyer and Deborah Potter in the
Florida primary (with major financial support from The Poynter Institute),
developed measurement instruments that could be used to define public journalism
by the content it produces. His dissertation, Exploring Operational Measures
of Citizen-based Journalism: A Pilot Study (1997), laid the groundwork
for the next step.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1997:</font></b>
The connection between public journalism and differences in content in
election coverage was finally documented by Meyer and Potter in a paper
presented to a <a href="meyrpot1.htm">National
Press Club seminar</a> in March. Now public journalism can be defined,
not only by what is in the heads of journalists, but by what they put in
the paper. A fuller version was presented to the annual meeting of the
Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication in Chicago
and is scheduled for publication by Chatham House as a chapter in a book
on polls in the 1996 national election campaign edited by political scientists
Paul Lavrakas and Michael Traugott.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><b>1997:</b> </font>Frank
Fee, a member of our first class of Freedom Forum Fellows, documented the
Raleigh News &amp; Observer portion of ASNE's "Project Reconnect." His
results were reported at AEJMC. and are the basis for his dissertation,
scheduled for completion in fall 1999. The project, funded by the Pew Center
for Civic Journalism, put the newsroom in closer touch with the suburb
of Garner. <a href="http://www.news-observer.com/daily/1997/08/10/tri00_side8.html">Fee's
report</a> to News &amp; Observer readers is available online.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1997:</font></b>
Meyer and Ph.D. alumnus David Arant of the University of Memphis did a
replication of Meyer's 1982 study of newspaper ethics for the American
Society of Newspaper Editors. It showed that the ethical sensitivity of
newspaper staffers is not, despite views to the contrary, declining. It
also indicated that acceptance of the values of public journalism does
not lead to a corresponding decline in traditional journalistic values.
The former study was presented to the Society of Professional Journalists
in Denver and published in the fall 1997 issue of Nieman Reports. The latter
was presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (St.
Louis, 1998) and published in The Journal of Mass Media Ethics (13:4, 1998).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><b>1998:</b> </font><i>Assessing
Public Journalism</i>, edited by Edmund Lambeth, Philip Meyer, and Esther
Thorson, was published in June by University of Missouri Press. Meyer's
chapter is called, "If It Works, How Will We Know?" The chapter proposes
ways of defining and assessing the effectiveness of public journalism.
Two of Meyer's students, John Bare and Carol Dykers, also have chapters
in the book based on their dissertations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1998: </font></b>Jurgen
Henn's M.A. thesis (also an AEJMC paper), "Sisyphus or Synergy," explored
the effect of newspaper-TV collaboration on citizen election knowledge
and participation, using the Meyer-Potter data.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><b>1998:</b> </font><i>The
Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics</i> (3:4, 1998) published
"The Effect of Pre-Election Polls on Issue Knowledge in the U.S. Presidential
Election of 1996" by Meyer and Potter. This paper, first presented at the
World Association for Public Opinion Research meeting in Edinburgh in September
1997, suggests that one of the assumptions made by public journalists --
that horse-race polls distract voters from learning about issues -- may
be in error and even counter-productive. The paper shows that people most
knowledgable about candidate poll standings also know more about issues
-- even when education and attention paid to the campaign are held constant.
Independent
verification of this thesis comes from three studies by Xinshu Zhao of
the UNC-CH faculty and Glen Bleske, our Ph.D. alumnus now at Chico State
University, reported in the same issue of the Harvard journal.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000000">1998:</font></b>
A connection between what public journalists put in the paper and on the
air and what citizens know and think was finally made with the help of
two UNC-CH political scientists. Marco R.Steenburgen and Timothy Vercellotti
joined with Meyer and Potter in presenting "Media Signals and Political
Learning: Traditional v. Civic Journalism" at the St. Louis AAPOR meeting.
Horse-race polls appear to be effective in drawing attention to the campaign
among the growing body of citizens who are not habitual newspaper readers.
Conversely, those newspapers that eschew polls for more detailed issue
coverage tend to lose the attention of that low readership group, and it
ends up, paradoxically, learning less about issues.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><b>1998:</b> </font>Three
student papers, from a spring seminar made possible by Knight Chair funding,
were presented at the August meeting of AEJMC:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Eric Rhodenbaugh</b>, a first-year
doctoral student, wrote "Missing the Link," which uses persuasion theory
to argue that where public journalism efforts have had an effect on citizen
interest and understanding it is largely because of the effort's mere existence,
and not because of any particular kind of content. Readers and viewers
know that a special effort is being made on their behalf and this alone
motivates them to learn more.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>David Loomis</b>, also a first-year
doctoral student, tested the theory that public journalism is a ruse by
cost-conscious publishers for doing cheaper journalism. He found instead
that the papers doing public journalism went to greater expense by using
a higher proportion of staff-written stories in their election coverage.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Andrea Verykoukis</b>, a second-year
master's student, used computer content analysis to find that public journalism
newspapers had a more "inspirational" tone in their stories through more
frequent use of such words as "virtue," "patriotism," "honesty," "courage,"
"wisdom," and the like. This result provides support for Buzz Merritt's
claim that public journalism is a basic cultural shift for working journalists.</font></blockquote>
<b>2000: </b>Ph.D. student Scott Maier and Deborah Potter wrote "Public
journalism through the television lens: How TV broadcasters covered Campaign
'96" for the <i>Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media</i>. (In
press).
<p><b>2000</b>: Meyer and Potter’s "Hidden Value: Polls and Public Journalism,"
a summary of their work on the 1996 campaign, suggests a missing link in
the causal chain from media intent to community spirit. It was published
in <i>Election Polls, the News Media, and Democracy</i>, edited by Paul
J. Lavrakas and Michael W. Traugott.
<p><b>2000</b>: The missing link is found by Ph.D. student David Loomis
and Meyer, reported in "Opinion Without Polls: Finding a Link Between Corporate
Culture and Public Journalism," <i>International Journal of Public Opinion
Research</i>, Autumn, 2000.
<p><b>2000:</b> Meyer summarized his and his students’ work for the benefit
of professionals in "Evaluating the Toolbox," <i>American Journalism Review</i>,
March 2000.
<p><b>2000:</b> Molly Putman examined coverage of the 1998 campaign by
the newspapers in the Meyer-Potter 1996 sample for her undergraduate honors
thesis and found that the commitment to public journalism, where it was
evidenced in 1996, tended to persist two years later.
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2002: </b>Meyer reported to the Batten
Symposium (Chapel Hill, April 22) on efforts to link the social responsiblity
aspects of public/civic journalism to the profitability of newspapers.
